        <h3 id="q3" class="collapsible-btn"> Can I use this balm if I’m pregnant? </h3>
        <p class="collapsible-content"> There can be an increase in skin sensitivity during pregnancy, so you may want
            to consult
            a
            healthcare professional
            before use. This balm contains Castor Oil, which some expectant mothers may have increased skin sensitivity
            to
            during pregnancy. Castor Oil can trigger muscle cramps and potentially induce labour in pregnant mothers. It
            is
            not
            recommended to consume Castor Oil during pregnancy. Avoid direct ingestion of Castor Oil if pregnant.
            Ingredients
            such as Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B3 & Vitamin B5 are generally considered safe for topical use during
            pregnancy.

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 id="q4" class="collapsible-btn"> Can I use this balm if I just had lip filler injections? </h3>
        <p class="collapsible-content"> Dermatologists recommend avoiding the use of cosmetic products on or around the
            mouth for
            at
            least 24 hours after
            treatment. An increase in swelling and skin sensitivity may lead to having an uncommon adverse reaction to
            any
            cosmetic product during that period. If your swelling has significantly reduced after that time, you may
            proceed
            to
            apply this balm cautiously. If your skin is still too sensitive for application, you can wash the balm off
            with
            a
            gentle soap and lukewarm water. </p>

        <h3 id="q5" class="collapsible-btn"> How do I dispose of the empty package responsibly? </h3>
        <p class="collapsible-content"> You can dispose of the Kraft paper package by placing it in your compost bin or
            in the
            non-recyclable waste bin, as
            it is readily biodegradable and will decompose naturally when exposed to the elements. </p>
